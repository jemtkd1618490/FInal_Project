# Final_project University of Minnesota

This repository contains all the deliverables for my final project from the University of Minnesota Cybersecurity Bootcamp

In this final project I was tasked with conducting three different engagements:

	- Hacking into a vulnerable machine to gather 4 flags
	- Blue Teaming the same machine by setting up alerts to capture logs for my offensive pentest
	- Doing network analysis by utilizing Wireshark to monitor malicious traffic
